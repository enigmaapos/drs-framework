🔐 Batch Guardian Council Advantage

In the original Guardian Council (GCSS / AGC):

Guardians themselves (the 7-of-X council) directly propose and approve recoveries.

If they are compromised, there is a risk that the same bad actors could just pick new guardians.

In the Batch Guardian Council upgrade:

There are two layers: Batch 1 (active guardians) and Batch 2 (backup guardians).

If Batch 1 is compromised, Batch 2 auto-activates.

But here’s the key upgrade:

Only the DAO / Governance can refill guardians (pick a new Batch 2 once the old one is activated).

That means bad actors who compromise Batch 1 (or even some of Batch 2) cannot re-seed themselves as future guardians.

Governance / DAO remains the only trusted source of truth for resetting guardians.

⚡ Why This Is So Powerful

Even if bad actors take the admin key or compromise Batch 1 guardians, they cannot install their own “puppet council.”

Governance / DAO is the root authority for refreshing guardians, meaning ultimate control is always brought back to the community.

This closes the biggest exploit vector: “Compromise guardians → install bad guardians → total takeover.”

✅ Advantages Over Original

Original GC: if compromised, reset still depends on insiders or last-honest-guardian.

Batch GC: if compromised, backup Batch + DAO-controlled refill ensures community power.

Result: Protocol/system/contract is always guaranteed to cycle back into DAO control, even under attack.

👉 In short:
The idea ensures DAO/Governance is the permanent anchor of legitimacy.
Guardians are like temporary operators, but the DAO is the permanent root.
