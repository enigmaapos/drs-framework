Batch Guardian Council (BGC) is not a totally separate invention — it’s an evolution of the DRS (Decentralized Recovery System) framework.

Think of it this way:

DRS (original):

Single guardian council (e.g., 5-of-7).

Provides recovery and compromise detection (6/7 warn, 7/7 lock).

Works great until that one council itself is captured.


BGC (upgraded DRS):

Two (or more) batches of guardian councils.

Batch-1 is active, Batch-2 is on standby.

If Batch-1 is compromised/locked, Batch-2 takes over immediately.

Only the DAO/governance can reseed new batches after a crisis.



So yes — BGC is still part of the DRS framework, just the next generation design.
It adds resilience against long-term capture by making sure there’s always another clean set of guardians, and that only the DAO (not attackers) can pick the new ones.
