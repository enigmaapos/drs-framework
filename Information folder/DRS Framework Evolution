DRS Framework Evolution

The Decentralized Recovery System (DRS) is a guardian-based security layer that protects smart contracts against lost keys, hacks, and role compromise. Over time, the framework has evolved into two main versions:


---

🔹 DRS v1 (Classic Guardian Council)

Single council of guardians (e.g., 5-of-7).

Protects the deployer and/or admin roles.

Recovery Flow:

1. Guardian proposes new admin/deployer.


2. Guardians approve (threshold reached).


3. Role is replaced safely.



Compromise Detection:

6/7 approvals = ⚠️ Warning.

7/7 approvals = 🚨 Auto-lock (possible full compromise).



✅ Strengths:

Simple and efficient.

Good protection against accidental key loss or partial hacks.


⚠️ Weakness:

If the entire council is compromised, attackers could permanently hijack the system.

🔹 DRS v2 (Batch Guardian Council — BGC)

Multiple batches of councils (e.g., Batch-1 active, Batch-2 standby).

Batch-1 governs day-to-day recovery.

If Batch-1 is compromised → Batch-2 automatically takes over.

Only the DAO/governance can reseed new batches, ensuring the system can’t be hijacked by attackers.


Recovery & Rotation Flow:

1. Batch-1 compromised or locked.


2. Batch-2 instantly activated as new council.


3. DAO/governance reseeds Batch-1 with new guardians.



✅ Strengths:

Resilient to entire council compromise.

Attackers can’t pick new guardians; only DAO can.

Provides continuous control back to the community.


⚡ Impact:

Shifts control from static multisig-like guardians to DAO-driven rotating guardianship.

Prevents permanent hijacks and ensures protocols remain community-owned long-term.

🔑 Which One to Use?

DRS v1 (Classic): Lighter, cheaper, easier to integrate. Best for smaller projects or early-stage protocols.

DRS v2 (BGC): Stronger, more future-proof. Best for protocols with large treasuries, high governance stakes, or long-term security needs.
