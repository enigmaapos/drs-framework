## **Catalyst Whitepaper (Fully Aligned Final Version)**

Universal Utility & Governance for All NFTs

---

### 1. Introduction

The NFT space has rapidly evolved, but it remains fragmented. Blue-chip collections dominate the spotlight, while thousands of smaller or abandoned projects struggle for relevance. Holders of failed or “junk” NFTs are left with no utility, no governance rights, and no pathway back into the ecosystem.

Catalyst changes this.

We are the first NFT-neutral staking and governance protocol, designed to give universal utility to every ERC-721 token — whether blue-chip, indie, or abandoned.

Catalyst is not a marketplace, nor a speculative platform. Catalyst is an infrastructure layer: a deflationary staking protocol where all NFTs can earn, burn, and participate in governance — with safeguards that protect credibility and sustainability.

👉 And uniquely, Catalyst is the first protocol to implement a **Decentralized Recovery System (DRS)** — a guardian-based **7-of-5** council model that protects deployer and admin keys from compromise, ensuring the highest level of security in the NFT ecosystem.

---

### 2. Vision

> To become the universal utility layer of the NFT ecosystem, where every NFT has value and every collection can contribute to shaping the future of decentralized communities.

And to pioneer security in DeFi/NFT protocols by introducing the first Decentralized Recovery System (DRS), ensuring resilience against admin compromise.

---

### 3. Mission

Empower Holders – Give all NFT owners, from BAYC whales to rug-pull survivors, a way to extract real value.

Balance Incentives – Reward credible collections while still including unverified ones through proof-of-burn mechanics.

Deflationary Tokenomics – Make CATA a sustainable asset through continuous burn mechanics and dynamic fees.

Governance for All – Create a governance model that scales with the ecosystem, balancing top collections with small contributors.

Bridge Legitimacy – Increase blue-chip acceptance by filtering junk responsibly without excluding survivors.

Secure by Design – Establish a new security standard with DRS (7:5 guardian council), protecting deployer and admin keys from compromise.

---

### 4. Goals

Establish CATA as the core staking & governance token of NFT utility.

Build a dual-tier ecosystem:
* Verified collections with full privileges.
* Unverified collections that must burn and prove commitment before upgrading.

Maintain a deflationary balance between minted rewards and burned CATA.

Provide a transparent, community-driven governance model based on burns and stake-age.

Position Catalyst as the infrastructure standard for NFT staking, governance, and protocol neutrality.

---

### 5. Core Philosophy

1. NFT-Neutral Utility – Every ERC-721 is unique on-chain, even if marketplaces call it “junk”.
2. Proof-of-Burn Legitimacy – Junk collections must burn extra CATA to join, aligning incentives and discouraging spam.
3. Adaptive Governance – Voting eligibility is dynamic, scaling with ecosystem growth.
4. Transparency & Fairness – Upgrades from Unverified → Verified require meeting objective on-chain conditions and governance approval.
5. Deflationary Economics – Registration fees, harvest burns, unstake burns, and bonus programs continuously destroy supply.
6. Guardian Security – Catalyst is the first protocol to integrate a Decentralized Recovery System (DRS), with dual 7:5 guardian councils ensuring recovery without centralization.

---

### 6. Tokenomics (CATA)

Token Name: Catalyst (CATA)
Type: ERC-20 Utility & Governance Token

**Deflationary Mechanics**
Harvest burn fee (dynamic % based on protocol load).
Unstake burn fee.
Collection registration fees.
Voluntary burns by users.

**Emission Mechanics**
Staking NFTs mints new CATA.
Base reward rate dynamically adjusts with participation.

**Hard-Coded Supply and Staking Caps (Aligned)**
* CATA token supply is **hard-capped at 1,000,000,000**. At deployment, 100,000,000 CATA were minted to the initial admin. Only the `CatalystStakingUpgradeable` contract can mint new supply, ensuring emissions are tied exclusively to staking participation and reward mechanics.
* Global staking capacity capped at **500,000,000 NFTs**:
    * **375,000,000** Term stakes
    * **125,000,000** Permanent stakes
* **Per-Collection Cap**: To prevent single-collection dominance, a hard cap of **20,000 staked NFTs** is enforced per registered collection contract.

**Immutable Fee Distribution**
Every protocol fee follows the permanent rule:
* **90% Burned** – permanently reduces supply.
* **9% Treasury** – governance-controlled community pool.
* **1% Owner (Deployer)** – immutable share allocated to the protocol creator/maintainer.

Applies to all events: registration, unstake, harvest, and voluntary burns.

**Treasury Usage**
The Treasury’s 9% share is controlled by governance and may be used for:
* Burner bonus distributions.
* Future community-approved initiatives (grants, ecosystem support, integrations, audits).

**Top 1% Burner Bonus**
Every cycle (~weekly), the top 1% of wallets ranked by burned CATA receive a bonus from the Treasury.
* The bonus pool is capped (default: 5% of Treasury per cycle).

---

### 7. Collection Tiers

**Verified (Standard)**
Normal registration & staking fees.
Full privileges: staking, governance, voting.
Custodial staking inside the protocol.

**Unverified (Junk / Rug Survivors)**
Must pay registration + surcharge escrow.
Reduced governance rights until upgraded.
Upgrade path: burn contribution + stake age + stakers + governance approval.

> If an unverified collection fails to upgrade within the required surcharge forfeit window, its escrow is automatically forfeited. **The forfeited escrow is subject to the immutable 90/9/1 split**: **90% burned, 9% allocated to the Treasury, and 1% allocated to the Deployer.**

**Blue-Chip (Curated / Trusted)**
Default assumption: already proven, not required to stake.
Non-custodial model: wallets register directly.
One-time fee per wallet for reward access if not staking.
If they choose to stake instead → same as Verified path, free of the extra wallet fee.
Benefit: avoids custody risks while still earning rewards.

---

### 8. Governance Model

**Burn-Weighted Collection Governance (BWCG)**:
Top collections by burned CATA get full voting rights.
Smaller collections participate with fractional weight once burn thresholds are met.
Stake-age requirement prevents flash-stake manipulation.
Per-collection vote cap prevents monopolies.

**Blue-Chip wallets**:
Gain full governance eligibility once the one-time wallet fee is paid or they participate via staking.

⚠️ **Immutable**: The **90/9/1 split cannot be changed**.

> Governance supports a wide range of proposal types, including: Base reward adjustments, Harvest fee updates, Unstake fee updates, Registration fee fallback, Voting parameter changes, Tier upgrades for collections, Guardian Council reseeding (active/standby batches), DAO upgrades (two-step commit process), Guardian Council contract upgrades (via UUPS), and Council lock clearing.

---

### 9. Guardian Council Security System (DRS)

> Catalyst secures its upgradeable contracts using the **Batch Guardian Council (BGC)** — a two-batch guardian model with 7 guardians in each batch.

* **Active Batch**: current guardians with operational authority.
* **Standby Batch**: pre-seeded guardians, ready to take over in case of compromise.

**Recovery Thresholds (Aligned)**:
* **5 of 7 approvals → Recovery valid**.
* **6 of 7 approvals → Raises a Warning and grants the Last Honest Guardian a 48h veto**.
* **7 of 7 approvals → Auto-Lock triggered, Standby batch activated immediately**.

**Execution Timelock (CRITICAL ALIGNMENT)**:
* Once a recovery proposal achieves the **5-of-7 threshold**, there is a mandatory, non-waivable **4-hour timelock** (`EXECUTION_TIMELOCK`) before the proposed action can be executed. This delay provides a final chance for monitoring and intervention.

DAO-Managed Reseeding: Governance can propose and commit new batches of guardians.

Recovery Proposals: Guardians may propose arbitrary calls (target + calldata) that execute atomically if approved.

---

### 10. Security, Scalability, Sustainability

**Security**: Guardian-based recovery (7:5 threshold), reentrancy protection, OpenZeppelin UUPS upgradeability.

> * All core modules (ERC20, Staking, Governance, Council) are deployed as **UUPS Upgradeable** contracts.
> * **Role Management Hardening**: The generic OpenZeppelin role management functions (`grantRole`, `revokeRole`, and `renounceRole`) are **disabled in all contracts and hard-coded to revert**. All role changes must occur via the governance proposal system or the Guardian Council recovery mechanism.
> * **Immutable Economics**: The **90/9/1 fee split is enforced at the contract level** and cannot be modified by governance.

**Scalability**:
Per-collection cap = **20,000 NFTs**; global staking cap = **500,000,000 NFTs**.

**Sustainability**: Continuous burn, capped treasury, immutable 90/9/1 split.

---

### 11. Roadmap

Phase 1: Core contract deployment (staking, burning, governance).
Phase 2: Frontend UI & community dashboard.
Phase 3: Governance bootstrapping; first upgrade votes.
Phase 4: Strategic integrations with NFT marketplaces & dApps.
Phase 5: Expansion of utility — cross-chain staking, DeFi integrations, NFT collateralization.

---

### 12. Conclusion

Catalyst is both a universal NFT utility layer and a guardian-secured protocol.

NFTs gain value: even junk NFTs.

Governance is fair: burn-weighted and capped.

Tokenomics are deflationary: immutable 90/9/1 split.

Security is advanced: Guardian Councils with compromise detection and last-resort protection.

### 🔧 Technical Appendix — Catalyst Smart Contract Architecture (Aligned with Current Contracts)

**1. Overview**
Catalyst is deployed as a modular, upgradeable protocol using the UUPS proxy standard.

**Immutable Rule**:
All fees follow the **90% Burn / 9% Treasury / 1% Deployer** split, enforced at the contract level and unchangeable by governance.

**2. Core Contracts**
* **CataERC20Upgradeable.sol**: Max Supply: **1,000,000,000 CATA** (hard cap). Minting is restricted to the `CatalystStakingUpgradeable` contract (`MINTER_ROLE`).
* **CatalystStakingUpgradeable.sol**: Custodial NFT staking contract. Supply Caps: Global: **500,000,000 NFTs**, Term: **375,000,000 NFTs**, Permanent: **125,000,000 NFTs**.
* **CatalystGovernanceUpgradeable.sol**: On-chain Burn-Weighted Collection Governance (BWCG). Governed by `BatchGuardianCouncil`.
* **BatchGuardianCouncilUpgradeable.sol**: Dual-Batch Model (Active/Standby, 7 guardians each). **Recovery Thresholds**: 5-of-7 approval, 6-of-7 warning + **48h veto**. **Mandatory 4-hour Execution Timelock** after approval.

**3. Security & Upgradeability**
* All contracts: `UUPSUpgradeable` + `AccessControlUpgradeable`.
* **Access Control Hardening**: `grantRole()`, `revokeRole()`, and `renounceRole()` are **overridden to revert** in all contracts, enforcing governance and recovery as the only pathways for role changes.
* Failover Mechanism: Standby guardian batch ensures automatic continuity in case of compromise.
