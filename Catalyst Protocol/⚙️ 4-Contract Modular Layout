‚öôÔ∏è 4-Contract Modular Layout

1. CATA.sol (ERC20 token)

Pure ERC20Upgradeable with burn + MINTER_ROLE.

Only CatalystStaking can mint rewards.

GuardianCouncil is admin.



---

2. CatalystStaking.sol (Core logic)

Contains all computations:

Collection Registration (verified/unverified/blue-chip).

Staking / Unstaking NFTs (custodial).

Reward computation (welcome bonus, harvest rewards).

Blue-chip logic (special rewards, collection-level benefits).

Burn tracking (for governance weight).

Emits data events for Governance to use (stakeAge, burns, collection stats).


üëâ This will now hold everything heavy from your merged file, except token minting (delegated to CATA) and governance voting lifecycle (moved out).


---

3. CatalystGovernance.sol

Manages proposals, votes, executions.

Voting weight = data pulled from CatalystStaking (burnedBy, stakeAge, collection stakes).

Lightweight (no computation) ‚Üí just consumes staking stats.



---

4. GuardianCouncil.sol

Manages security & upgrade authority.

Protects both CATA and CatalystStaking.

7 guardians, 5 approvals required for recovery / upgrade execution.
