üõ° Catalyst Protocol Threat Model

1. DAO Layer (root authority)
Attacker: Malicious DAO (compromised governance, 51% attack, or key theft).
Targets:
Replace guardians.
Upgrade the council contract.
Replace DAO with another address.
Protections:
None above DAO ‚Äî DAO is the root of trust.
Risk is social/governance (token distribution, governance capture).

2. Council Layer (BatchGuardianCouncilUpgradeable)
Attacker: Colluding guardians (‚â• 5/7).
Targets:
Catalyst contracts (Staking, ERC20, Governance).
Potentially the council itself (if self-targeting allowed).
Protections:
Threshold: 5-of-7 needed.
6/7 raises a warning.
7/7 forces lock + standby activation.
Last-honest veto: one honest guardian can stop 6/7 collusion.
DAO can reseed or override if things go bad.

3. Catalyst Contracts (Staking, ERC20, Governance)
Attacker: The council (via recovery calls).
Targets:
swapAdmin ‚Üí replace admins.
UUPS upgrade ‚Üí deploy malicious implementations.
ERC20 minting cap enforcement (guarded but council can install malicious upgrades).
Protections:
Contracts only trust the council (not individual guardians).
DAO can reseed the council if it misbehaves.

4. Guardians (individuals)
Attacker: Rogue guardian(s).
Targets:
Attempt unilateral proposals.
With 2‚Äì3 colluders: no impact.
With 5+ colluders: can pass proposals.
Protections:
5/7 threshold.
6/7 ‚Üí warning + last honest veto.
7/7 ‚Üí lock ‚Üí standby takes over.

5. Users
Attacker: Malicious stakers, voters, or token holders.
Targets:
Try to exploit staking reward logic.
Try to manipulate governance with flash loans.
Protections:
Protocol logic in Staking/Governance.
Not directly relevant to council-level security, but still an attack surface.

‚öñÔ∏è Risk Summary
DAO risk: Absolute root of trust. If DAO is corrupted ‚Üí whole system can be captured.
Council risk: Medium. Guardians need 5/7 collusion, mitigated by veto/lock.
Catalyst contracts risk: Medium. Fully controlled by council, so depend on council integrity.
User-level risk: Low-to-medium, depends on contract logic (separate audits).

‚úÖ Stability Assessment
If council can self-target ‚Üí guardians have emergency flexibility, but also the power to rewrite council.
If council cannot self-target ‚Üí DAO is the only root authority. This strengthens separation of powers but introduces DAO-liveness risk.
