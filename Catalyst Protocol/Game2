Okay, I see 🙂
You want a pool-based HTML game with this logic:

A player registers with 10 ERC20 tokens.

The contract/game then burns 70% (7 tokens).

The remaining 30% (3 tokens) goes into a reward pool.

Later, players can earn from the pool (like 10–30% return depending on rules).


This is basically a staking + burn + reward distribution game. Let’s break it down:


---

⚖️ Game Flow (simple version)

1. Register / Stake

Player pays 10 tokens to the contract.

Contract automatically burns 7 (sends to 0xdead).

3 goes into a shared reward pool.



2. Reward Accumulation

The pool grows as more players register.

Each registered player can later claim a return (10%–30%) depending on rules (e.g., random spin, level achieved, or time held).



3. Claim Rewards

Player plays a mini HTML game (spin wheel, memory flip, clicker, etc.).

Based on outcome, contract lets them withdraw 10%–30% of what they put in (from the pool).

🔗 Smart Contract (ERC20 Pool Game)

Here’s a very simple Solidity example (not production safe, just concept):

// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.20;

interface IERC20 {
    function transferFrom(address from, address to, uint amount) external returns (bool);
    function transfer(address to, uint amount) external returns (bool);
    function decimals() external view returns (uint8);
}

contract BurnPoolGame {
    IERC20 public token;
    address public burnAddress = 0x000000000000000000000000000000000000dEaD;
    uint256 public totalPool;

    mapping(address => uint256) public deposits;

    constructor(address _token) {
        token = IERC20(_token);
    }

    function register(uint256 amount) external {
        require(amount > 0, "Must send tokens");

        // Take tokens
        require(token.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount), "Transfer failed");

        // Burn 70%
        uint256 burnAmount = (amount * 70) / 100;
        token.transfer(burnAddress, burnAmount);

        // Add 30% to pool
        uint256 poolShare = amount - burnAmount;
        totalPool += poolShare;

        // Track deposit
        deposits[msg.sender] += amount;
    }

    function claim(uint256 percent) external {
        require(percent >= 10 && percent <= 30, "Only 10%–30%");
        require(deposits[msg.sender] > 0, "Not registered");

        uint256 claimable = (deposits[msg.sender] * percent) / 100;
        require(totalPool >= claimable, "Not enough pool");

        totalPool -= claimable;
        deposits[msg.sender] = 0; // one-time claim
        token.transfer(msg.sender, claimable);
    }
}

👉 What it does:

Player registers by sending tokens → contract burns 70% → 30% goes to pool.

Later, player calls claim(10–30) to withdraw reward from pool.

Pool shrinks as players claim.

🎮 Frontend (HTML + JS Game Layer)

You can wrap this with a fun mini HTML game. Example:

Spin Wheel → decides if user gets 10%, 20%, or 30%.

Memory Cards → if they match 2 cards, they get 30%, else 10–20%.

Clicker game → performance decides reward.


When game finishes, you call:

await gameContract.claim(percent); // percent = 10, 20, or 30

Frontend just needs:

Connect wallet (MetaMask).

Call approve → register(amount).

Play game → call claim(percent).



---

🔥 Why this is unique

Every registration shrinks supply (70% burn).

The reward pool is community-funded (30%).

Fun HTML game decides payout.

Creates a deflationary + gamified token economy.

⚠️ Notes:

If this is a real-money token, double-check local regulations (because burn+pool+return looks like staking/lottery).

Make sure to add anti-abuse rules (one claim per deposit, cooldowns, etc.).

Security audits are essential if you deploy mainnet.

👉 Do you want me to build you a ready-to-run HTML Spin Wheel game (like the one I gave earlier) but connected to this BurnPoolGame contract so rewards are actually pulled from the pool?
