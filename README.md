**Decentralized Recovery System (DRS)** is a guardian-based security layer for smart contracts.  
It provides a robust alternative to traditional multisig, timelock, or DAO-only approaches.  

DRS enables:
- Fast recovery from lost or compromised deployer/admin keys.
- Guardian-based approval flow (e.g., 5-of-7 or 4-of-7).
- Automatic compromise detection (warnings at 6/7, auto-lock at 7/7).
- Reset and recovery mechanisms controlled by valid owners or last honest guardians.
- Upgrade-safe and pluggable security, usable with any Solidity contract.

## âœ¨ Features

- **Guardian Council Security System (GCSS)**: Protects deployer addresses.
- **Admin Guardian Council (AGC)**: Protects `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` (upgrade/role manager).
- **Shared Guardian Council**: Single council for both deployer and admin.
- **Batch Guardian Council (BGC)**: Dual-batch system for faster failover â€” if Batch 1 is compromised, Batch 2 automatically steps in.
- **Flexible Thresholds**: Configurable guardian size (e.g., 5-of-7, 4-of-7).
- **Failsafe Locks**: Auto-lock when full compromise is suspected.
- **Recovery Flow**: Propose â†’ Approve â†’ Execute â†’ Reset guardians if needed.

ðŸ”„ Module Options

Module	Description	Use Case

GCSS	Guardian Council for deployer role	Protects deployer fee receiver

ðŸ’¡ Note:
DRS is modular â€” projects can choose between classic Guardian Councils (GCSS/AGC/Shared) or the new Batch Guardian Council depending on their risk model.
