# drs-framework
Decentralized Recovery System (DRS) is a guardian-based security layer for smart contracts. It enables fast recovery from lost or compromised keys using 5-of-7 guardian approvals, detects suspicious activity, and auto-locks under full compromise. Lightweight, modular, and upgrade-safe.

# Decentralized Recovery System (DRS)

**Decentralized Recovery System (DRS)** is a guardian-based security layer for smart contracts.  
It provides a robust alternative to traditional multisig, timelock, or DAO-only approaches.  

DRS is designed for protocols that need:
- Fast recovery from lost or compromised deployer/admin keys.
- Guardian-based approval flow (e.g., 5-of-7).
- Automatic compromise detection (warnings at 4/7, lock at 7/7).
- Reset and recovery mechanisms controlled by valid owners or last honest guardians.
- Upgrade-safe and pluggable security, usable with any Solidity contract.

## âœ¨ Features
- **Guardian Council Security System (GCSS)**: Protects deployer addresses.
- **Admin Guardian Council (AGC)**: Protects `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` (upgrade/role manager).
- **Shared Guardian Council**: One council for both deployer and admin.
- **Flexible Thresholds**: Configurable guardian size (e.g., 5-of-7, 4-of-7).
- **Failsafe Locks**: Auto-lock when full compromise suspected.
- **Recovery Flow**: Propose â†’ Approve â†’ Execute â†’ Reset guardians if needed.
